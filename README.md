=========================

Markdown is awesome. ContentEditable is awesome. How about we display the parsed markdown, but let users edit the base markdown on focus?

### Tests

1. Install dependencies with ```bower install``` and ```npm install```.
2. Make sure you have grunt-cli... ```npm install -g grunt-cli```.
3. Run tests with ```grunt test```.
